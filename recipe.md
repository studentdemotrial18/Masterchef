RECIPE:


PREPARATION:

Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F for 20 minutes 
Place cupcake liners in a standard muffin tin.


CUPCAKE BATTER:

Whisk Dry:
 Whisk flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.

Heat Milk-Butter:
 Place butter and milk in a heatproof jug and microwave 2 minutes on high to melt butter. Do not let milk bubble and boil. Cover and leave in microwave to keep very warm 

Mix eggs:
 In a separate bowl, beat eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6 of a handheld beater.

Add sugar:
 With the beater still going, pour the sugar in over 30 seconds.

Beat until tripled:
 Beat eggs for 6 minutes on speed 8, or until tripled in volume and almost pure white.

Add flour:
 When the egg is whipped, scatter 1/3 flour across surface, then beat on Speed 1 for 5 seconds. Stop beating, add half remaining flour, then mix on Speed 1 for 5 sec. Add remaining flour, then mix on Speed 1 for 5 - 10 sec until the flour is just mixed in. Once you can’t see flour, stop straight away.

Temper milk:
 Pour hot milk, vanilla and oil into the now empty flour bowl. Add about 3/4 cups of the Egg Batter into the hot milk . Use a whisk to mix until smooth.

Slowly add milk:
 With the beater on Speed 1, pour the Milk mixture into the Egg Batter over 15 seconds, then turn beater off.

Scrape and final mix:
 Scrape down sides and base of bowl. Beat on Speed 1 for 10 seconds - batter should now be smooth and pourable.


BAKE:

Fill muffin tin: Pour batter into muffin tin, filling 2/3 of the way up. Do not fill more. Easiest to use a standard ice cream scoop with lever.

Bake 22 minutes or until golden and toothpick inserted into middle comes out clean.


COOL & FROST:
Remove from oven. Cool just 2 minutes then use a fork to help remove and place on cooling rack. Cool completely before icing with frosting of choice.

FROSTING:

1 In medium bowl, mix powdered sugar and butter with spoon or electric mixer on low speed. Stir in  vanilla and 1 tablespoon of the milk.

2 Gradually beat in just enough remaining milk to make frosting smooth and spreadable. If frosting is too thick, beat in more milk, a few drops at a time. If frosting becomes too thin, beat in a small amount of powdered sugar. Frosts 13x9-inch cake generously, or fills and frosts an 8- or 9-inch two-layer cake.
