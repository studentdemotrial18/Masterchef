# cup-cake


hello..Today i am sharing the recipe to make cupcake with vanilla frosting

These Vanilla Cupcakes are …..

Soft and fluffy, with a plush velvety crumb

Infused with elegant buttery and vanilla flavours

Perfectly shaped with a sweet golden dome

Much more tender than your usual run-of-the-mill cupcake recipes

Less sweet than typical cupcakes

Safer to make than typical “cream butter and sugar” recipes

and Stay fresh and moist for 4 days (minimum).
